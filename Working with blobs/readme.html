            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Some cameras support uploading and downloading of large binary objects. These objects can be a firmware image, calibration data, overlay data, ...
                A few functions are exposed to handle this transaction. Since the existense of these blobs are camera specific you should refer to the camera properties documentation to see which properties are supported.<br />
                <dl class="note">
                    <dt>
                        <b>Note</b>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        This sample was made with a <i>Gobi Bolometer (Rev1) - F020</i> camera where we will store the calibration pack, in the camera. Also, a calibration pack is unique to each individual camera, before executing this sample place the calibration pack in this sample's directory.
                        The name should be pack.xca or change the filename in function <i>fopen (line 30)</i> to your custom path.
